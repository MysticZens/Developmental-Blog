            <h1>Week 1 Developmental Blog</h1>
            <p>For this week, I have learnt how to implement html codes to develop a new website, I have learnt how to start a html file and 
            create codes based on it. I have learnt the diferent elements such as div/span, image tag, headings, paragraph and etc.

        <h1>Week 2 Developmental Blog</h1>
        <p>For this week, I have learnt how to decorate my webpage using either style.css, linking it
        or using style element. I have also learnt what are the footers/headers/articles/navigations element
        instead of using the div element, and learnt how to change the font size, colour of font, use google fonts
        for different headings/paragraphs/subheadings/etc. I have learnt how to code more in index.html and style.css.

            <h1>Week 3 Developmental Blog</h1>
            <p>For this week, I have learnt how to create new forms for my website, using buttons, radio checkbuttons, 
            input text, identified classes and attributes on my elements for CSS styling. I have also learnt how to format
            my lists using flexboxes horizontally and have a fixed width between each list. I know what are the uses
            and meanings of the different positions such as Relative, Absolute and Fixed position. With Z-index, I learnt 
            how to create more options to choose for a list, controlling the depth of the elements on the page.

            <h1>Week 4 Developmental Blog</h1>
            <p>For this week, I have learnt how to use GitHub to create a new repository and upload my documentation, README.md
            as well as update the repository in GitHub. I understand how to create my first GitHub page using the extensions of Git and
            GitHub. In addition, I learnt how to create responsive images using CSS and resize it on mobile version.
            I can change the formatting from a desktop webpage to a mobile version of the webpage.

            <h1>Week 5 Developmental Blog</h1>
            <p>For this week, I have started on how to implement basic JavaScript codes into my html documentation, 
            bringing new and working functions on my website, being able to change an element with Javascript or identify 
            the attribute to do styling, instead of CSS on my website. With that, I have also learnt how to use the Console extension
            using inspect.

            <h1>Week 6 Developmental Blog</h1>
            <p>For this week, I have learnt how to start on coding Javascript, applying Javascript in my HTML and CSS codes.
                This week, we learnt how to use for loop in Javascript, learnt the basics of constructors, if else statement, etc. We also
                learnt how to use DOM (Document Object Model) to get the ID, Class or Tag of the element and retrieve the inner HTML or text content.
                We also learnt how to create functions and create objects and methods inside the function. Using functions, we can access the value
                of the element or text content and change specific content with it. We can also use DOM to change the CSS styling of the HTML page.

            <h1>Week 7 Developmental Blog</h1>
            <p>In Week 7, we have recapped on how to use DOM (Document Object Model) and learnt on JSON local storage as well as event handling. Using JSON, 
                we can create functions that can store the JSON data inside the storage. JSON looks exactly like an object literal syntax, however it is not actually
                an object. In JSON, I have also learnt the built-in functions to retrieve the storage items and store more data inside JSON storage. Learning about
                Event Handling and Validation, I have learnt built-in functions such as .EventListener where you can make the event occur by calling the event name and the function.
                For example, some events are called click, blur, focus, etc. For validation, I have learnt that we can validate the form to any condition that we like, based on
                how we set the condition. For example, if I want the user to type the password to a certain word limit, I can use validation such as focus to make sure that the password does not
                exceed 8 words.

            <h1>Week 8 Developmental Blog</h1>
            <p>In Week 8, I have learnt how to use jQuery to change the styling of my webpage and also select elements in the HTML document using 
                jQuery. jQuery also allowed me to be able to simplify JavaScript functions and calls, making things much more convenient and easier for coding
                in JavaScript. I have also learnt how to use API, which is to take the data from any sort of website and display the current details into my webpage.
                Using Postman, it allows me to get the JSON file to display the details inside the JSON storage.

            <h1>Week 9 Developmental Blog</h1>
            <p>In Week 9, I have started on learning how to use Bootstrap to have a base template of my website using the developed baseline of HTML and CSS and JS codes.
            Using Bootstrap, it helped me to create a beautiful starting page by just adapting and install the Bootstrap files and codes. Besides Bootstrap, I have also learnt
            about Charts, on how you can use Boostrap to create a base template on Tables and Charts. Some examples of Tables and Charts are Line Charts, Radar Charts and Pie & Donut Charts.

            <h1>Week 12 Developmental Blog</h1>
            <p>Week 12's lesson taught me about how to use NoSQL, which is different from SQL, to store our databases and change the database accordingly using jQuery and using a simple contact form to change it.
            With NoSQL, the database is not organised properly and it is not ordered. Therefore, using a simple contact form to link the database, we can make a dashboard to display the details of the database, and even
            update or delete the database through the 4 methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE. I have also learnt how to start up a database through a new website called restdb.io. Using the database, we can link the link and the API key
            to use the methods that I have mentioned above.
